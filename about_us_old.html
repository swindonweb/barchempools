        <h2>About Us</h2>


        <p>Primary Insurance & Finance Services opened their doors to the public in April 1992. Our proposition is multi-tied and able to offer products from the whole of the mortgage market and from a select panel of protection, pension and investment providers.

        A family run business that prides itself on a personal service; we believe customer care is our ‘Primary’ concern</p>


        <p><a href="our_commitment.htm" class="button">Click here for our commitment to you - our customer</a></p>

        <p>The value of pensions and investments can fall as well as rise, you may get back less than you invested.</p>

        <p>Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage.</p>
